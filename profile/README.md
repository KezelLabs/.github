# 🛠️ KezelLabs

**Technology is for everyone. Period.**

At KezelLabs, we believe that no one should need help to access technology – not when they first power it on, not ever. That’s why we’re building open-source tools and frameworks that empower users to navigate digital spaces independently, regardless of their abilities.  

Our goal? Make powerful, intuitive systems that adapt to the user, not the other way around.

### 🚀 **Our Projects:**

- **KezelOS:**  
  A fork of LineageOS reimagined with accessibility as its core feature, not an afterthought.  
  - Voice-guided setup for first-time users – because independence should start from the moment you turn it on.  
  - Real-time captioning that handles background noise, multiple voices, and diverse accents.  
  - Customizable voice packs, allowing users to choose voices that reflect their identity.

- **Voice Setup Wizard:**  
  A hands-free, audio-driven onboarding experience, designed for users who can’t see the screen but still want full control.

- **Captioning Toolkit:**  
  Real-time transcription with adaptive noise filtering. Because “loud and clear” should be a given, not a luxury.  

- **Directional Audio Control:**  
  Focus the mic on specific sources, so users can prioritize the sounds that matter.

### 🌱 **Why We Exist:**  
We’re here to challenge the status quo – to make tech that doesn’t just accommodate users but **empowers** them.  
KezelLabs isn’t about “solving disabilities” – it’s about building systems that don’t assume anything about the user, except that they deserve full access to the world of technology.

### 📦 **Modular, Open, and Ready to Integrate:**  
Each KezelLabs project is designed as a standalone module, so developers can integrate accessibility features without overhauling their entire stack.  

- `@kezellabs/voice-setup` – Voice-guided setup for first boot and beyond.  
- `@kezellabs/captioner` – Dynamic, context-aware transcription.  
- `@kezellabs/audio-router` – Focused audio capture and routing.
